The 123 promo allows prepaid subscribers to make calls at a fixed cost. See figure below. Subs also have the option of opting out by dialing *123# to revert to the previous rates. &lt;br/&gt;

==Process flow==
&lt;blockquote&gt;

# By default, all Prepaid SCs point to Rating 11 which has the new rates
# Subs who prefer to pay per min can now opt out of the promo by dialing *123# or through the 123 UNTLD Promo option on *323#
# CAIN Plan 16164 is activated. A refill profile is sent to the AIR to perform a SC change [300 &gt; 301, 445 &gt; 444, 128 &gt; 130, other prepaid &gt; 116]
# The new SC points to Rating 13 which has the old ($1.29/min)rates
# If a sub wishes to opt back in to the promo they can do so by dialing *123# or through the 123 UNTLD Promo option on *323#
# CAIN Plan 16158 is activated. A refill profile is sent to the AIR to perform the SC change [301 &gt; 300, 444 &gt; 445, 130 &gt; 128, 116 &gt; 107]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===AIR changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; Two new Refill Profiles (OPTI, OPTO) were created for this promo. They were added to the Refill tariff with a new Refill Segmentation ID to perform the SC change when the sub opts in to or out of the promo.

[[File:AIR_SC_Change.jpeg|border]] &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===SDP changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Rating 11 was set up as the default tariff with the rate/call. Rating 13 was created as the opt out tariff for subs who prefer per min charging.

====Rating Tariff====

The Digi-digi rate was set up by charging a fee of $1 at the start of the call (the first second) and the rest of the call would be free. &lt;br/&gt;

[[File:123_Digi-digi.jpg|border]]

The Digi-bmobile and digi-landline rate was set up by charging a fee of $2 at the start of the call (the first second) and the rest of the call would be free. &lt;br/&gt;

[[File:123_Digi-bmobile.jpg|border]]

The Digi-intl (Zone 1 and Zone 2) rate was set up by charging a fee of $3 at the start of the call (the first second) and the rest of the call would be free. &lt;br/&gt;

[[File:123_Zone1.jpg|border]] &lt;br/&gt;

[[File:123_Zone2.jpg|border]]

The Digi-intl (Zone 3 and Zone 4) rate was set up by charging a fee of $3 and $9 respectively at the start of the call (the first second) and the rest of the call would be free. &lt;br/&gt;

[[File:123_Zone3_4.jpg|border]]

SMS on-net, off-net and to international were all set up to charge $0.50 &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:123_SMS.jpg|border]]

====Ussd Text Messages Tariff====
&lt;blockquote&gt;

SoCNs were set up to be sent to subs on the 123 promo informing them of the per call rate.

[[File:123_SOCNs.jpeg|border]] &lt;br /&gt;

* Digi-Digi Calls ($1)
''Your call is connecting. Don't forget! Talk UNLIMITED to any Digicel number for just TTD1 per call with our new 123 Unltd Promo! To Opt Out dial *123#.''

* Digi-Bmobile ($2)
''Your call is connecting. Don't forget! Talk UNLTD to any Bmobile number for TTD2/call with our 123 Unltd Promo! To Opt Out dial *123#.''

*Digi-Flow ($2)
''Your call is connecting. Don't forget! Talk UNLTD to any Flow number for TTD2/call with our 123 Unltd Promo! To Opt Out dial *123#.''

* Digi-Fixed ($2)
''Your call is connecting. Don't forget! Talk UNLTD to any other local network for TTD2/call with our 123 Unltd Promo! To Opt Out dial *123#.''

* Zone 1, Zone 2 ($3)
''Your call is connecting. Don't forget! Talk UNLIMITED to any Int'l number for as low as TTD3/call with our new 123 Unltd Promo! To Opt Out dial *123#.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Announcements====
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A new announcement ID was set up for opted out SCs. The opted in SCs are now receiving a new announcement for Account Balance low when balance is less than $2. &lt;br/&gt;
[[File:123_announcement.PNG|border]]

&lt;br/&gt;This value was changed on the opted in SCs as well. &lt;br/&gt;
[[File:123_announcement_balance.PNG|border]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Low Balance Notification====
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To cater for the LBNA messages below $2 for opted in subs, the Notification value had to be updated on these SCs. &lt;br/&gt;
[[File:123_notification_balance.PNG|border]]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===CAIN changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;u&gt;'''Opt Out Plan''' &lt;/u&gt; 
*CAIN plan 16164 (123 Unlimited Promo Opt-out) was created, which sends refill profile OPTO to the AIR
*This plan was filtered to block the Opt-Out Service Classes (116, 130, 301, 444).
&lt;u&gt;'''Opt In Plan''' &lt;/u&gt;
*CAIN plan 16158 (123 Unlimited Promo Opt-in) was created, which sends refill profile OPTI to the AIR
*This plan was filtered to only allow activation for the Opt-Out Service Classes (116, 130, 301, 444).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===UMM changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;

For this promotion a new UMM menu had to be created. This menu was created specifically to opt-in or opt-out of the 123 Unlimited Promotion. The code used to access this UMM menu was *123#. The option to opt-in or opt-out of the 123 Unlimited Promotion was also added to the *323# menu.

'''&lt;u&gt; UMM Menu *123# &lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Menu_123.jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

Logic:
* If subscriber has opted-out of the 123 Unlimited Promotion (they are on one of the service classes in service group 35) and dials *123#, the only plan they should see to activate is the opt-in plan (16158).
* If the subscriber is opted-in (default) and dials *123#, the only plan they should see to activate is the opt-out plan (16164).

'''&lt;u&gt; UMM Menu *123#/*323# Definitions &lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:123_Definitions.jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt; UMM Menu *123#/*323# Messages&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:123_Messages.jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt; UMM Menu *323# &lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt;
Subscriber dials *323# while opted-out
[[File:Menu_323(a).jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

Subscriber dials *323# while opted-in
[[File:Menu_323(b).jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

Item Refs
[[File:Menu_323(c).jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===BE changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The tt.xml file was edited as follows:
* The opt-out service classes (116, 130, 301 &amp; 444) were pulled out of their initial service groups and placed into a new service group to control the menu options seen when the subscriber is currently opted-in or opted out.

[[File:123_BE_tt.jpeg]]

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===LBNA changes===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A new LBNA message was configured for all subscribers opted in to the 123 Unlimited promotion. The LBNA threshold was set to TTD 2.00.
 
[[File:123_LBNA_Services.jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

The LBNA message configured can be seen below.
[[File:123_LBNA_Messages.jpeg]] &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
